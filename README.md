This is the final project on my class Computational Physics.
I investigated the GHZ state using IBM quantum computer. This mainly helps me in understanding  the physics of quantum entanglement.

## Youtube video

The link to my Youtube Video: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYb8LfBDKWo

The video is slightly differently from my report, which focus more on the entanglement between three qubits, namely the GHZ state. And I tried to explain the idea of entanglement with three particles in my report. It is a little confusing I believe, so in the video, I only used two particle  entanglement (Bell State) as my example.

The Script for the video is attached, simply named “script.pdf”.

The report talks about the realization of a GHZ state on IBM quantum computer, the video did not go into that, for simplicity I only showed how to achieve the Bell State in the video.
